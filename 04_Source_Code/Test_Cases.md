# Test Cases

The prototype uses predefined test cases to verify risk score calculation and risk classification.

| Test Case | Likelihood | Impact | Expected Score | Expected Level |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| TC01 | 1 | 1 | 1 | Low |
| TC02 | 2 | 2 | 4 | Low |
| TC03 | 1 | 5 | 5 | Medium |
| TC04 | 2 | 4 | 8 | Medium |
| TC05 | 2 | 5 | 10 | High |
| TC06 | 3 | 4 | 12 | High |
| TC07 | 4 | 4 | 16 | High |
| TC08 | 4 | 5 | 20 | Very High |
| TC09 | 5 | 5 | 25 | Very High |

## Boundary Testing

The test cases include boundary values between risk levels:

- 4 → Low
- 5 → Medium
- 9 → Medium
- 10 → High
- 16 → High
- 17 → Very High

These test cases verify that the prototype correctly applies the defined risk classification boundaries.
